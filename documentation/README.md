# Documentation

The documentation in this repository pertain to a book called
_The Infinispan Server Guide_.

It is written along the same guidelines as core Infinispan documentation,
more of which can be learned about [here](https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/blob/6.0.x/documentation/README.md).

This book is incorporated in the [Infinispan Documentation Home](http://infinispan.org/documentation)

## Differences from the core Infinispan documentation

Documentation written for Hot Rod clients should be in a single AsciiDoc
document titled `index.adoc` and stored in this directory.
You may use tables of contents and various other AsciiDoc features as 
described in the [document authoring guidelines](http://infinispan.org/docs/6.0.x/contributing/contributing.html#_writing_documentation_and_faqs).

All other aspects of the [document authoring guidelines](http://infinispan.org/docs/6.0.x/contributing/contributing.html#_writing_documentation_and_faqs)
must be adhered to, particularly sections on style and voice.
